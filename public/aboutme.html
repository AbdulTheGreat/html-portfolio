<h1>About Me</h1>

<p style="text-align: justify;">   My name is Abdul and i was born in the middle east, in the historically rich country "Iraq" City of "Salah AL deen"
   I have been passionate about Computers, since my young age, my country had some difficulties to provide me with the 
   resources to fullfil my potential, as i have always wanted to become a professional developer. After the American-Iraqi 
   war I have migrated to Ukraine-Odessa where i started building up my career to reach and realize my dreams.
   
   Having studied in Ukraine, enlglish language university, I have gained the skills and abilities needed to pursue my dreams.
   While following my dreams and working in Ukraine, Ukraine-Russia tensions and sparks of war started. I have started planning
   to leave the country.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">   Moved to the UK and started working as a Technical Support analyst at a hotel management company in London, continued my courses
   but it wasn't easy to get my documents recognized in the UK due my original nationality, however, with persistance and efforts, my 
   dreams prevailed and I managed to start a new job. 

   At the Cyber Resilience Center as a Cybersecurity consultant funded by the Mayor's I worked with the Cyber intelligence department 
   of the Metropolitan Police of London.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">   I have explored many different aspects of the information technology and decided to continue my first dream, but with slight amendment.
  This time i am heading to be the best Web Developer, with trainging and many courses I am now equipped witht the required tools to 
  start working at any respective company. I have done hands-on courses with the most popular instructors on Udemy academy, and I was doing 
  while working as a Support Specialist at the Atheletics company Lululemon in Vancouver/Canada.</p>
